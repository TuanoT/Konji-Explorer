# Konji Explorer
This reposity contains a wiki that parses data from Konji's project files.
The current version of Konji (found [here](https://tom-purcell.itch.io/konji)) is slightly ahead of the files used in this repo.
My younger self was not good at things like version control or saving files but if we ever find the current version of Konji we can slip it into this repo and Konji Explorer will automatically parse the new data.
